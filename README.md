3. **Data Summarization:**
   - Gain a basic understanding of the data, including average purchase amounts and the distribution of values.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Create charts and graphs to illustrate data trends, highlighting popular products and peak purchase days.

5. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Identify connections between different pieces of information, exploring potential relationships.

6. **Conclusion Drawing:**
